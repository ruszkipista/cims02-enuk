        <h1>RULES OF THE GAME</h1>
        <p>There&rsquo;s a lot to discover on the ice floes of Greenland &hellip;</p>
        <p>Enuk, the little Eskimo boy, is really excited. He&rsquo;s been looking forward to wandering around with his
            brothers for a long time. Up until now he&rsquo;s only heard stories about all the polar bears and seals,
            but now he will get to see the animals for himself. He&rsquo;s also going to be allowed to help build a new
            igloo, and that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s looking forward to the most.</p>
        <p>The players will have to try to collect as many animal tiles as possible. The one who has the most tiles at
            the end is the winner!</p>

        <!-- GAME SEQUENCE -->
        <h2>Game Sequence</h2>
        <p>The game runs in two phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First Phase: Collecting tiles and building the igloo </li>
            <li>Finishing Phase: Declaring and collecting tiles</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- FIRST PHASE -->
        <h2>First Phase</h2>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">The game starts with the table covered with all the shuffled tiles facing
            down:<br><img src="./assets/img/rules-example-00.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">It is Blue player&rsquo;s turn now. They turn over a tile - herring. If Blue
            ends their move now they can collect it.<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-01.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">But Blue rather flips another tile - it is a polar bear. If Blue ends their move
            now they can collect both of these tiles:<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-02.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">However, Blue decides to turn over another tile. Another herring.There is no
            threat between the herring and the polar bear, so no-one flees. Therefore it&rsquo;s still the Blue
            player&rsquo;s turn.<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-03.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">Now a salmon turns up!<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-04.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">The herring fears the salmon so they flee!<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-05.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">Player Blue has to turn back the 2 herring tiles,<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-06.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">and the remaining 2 face-up tiles are collected and placed on their stack:<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-07.png">
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-stack-2.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">This signals the end of Blue&rsquo;s turn. Now it&rsquo;s Orange&rsquo;s turn.
            Orange flips a tile - it is a seal:<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-08.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">In their next move, they remember the positions of the 2 herring tiles and, as
            the herring doesn&rsquo;t fear the seal, they can be turned up safely:<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-09.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">Orange then decides that 3 tiles are enough and ends their move by collecting
            the 3 face-up tiles and adding them to their stack:<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-10.png">
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-stack-5.png">
        </p>
        <h2>The rules during First Phase</h2>
        <p>Turn over any tile you like when it&rsquo;s your move.</p>
        <p>When a reindeer is turned over the sun piece moves one position to the right. This represents the passing
            of time. If the sun reaches its last position the First Phase ends.</p>
        <p><img src="./assets/img/rules-reindeer.png">
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-sun-position-2.png">
        </p>
        <p>You can keep turning over tiles until:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You decide you no longer want to turn over more tiles. You can end your move by clicking on the
                &ldquo;collect tiles&rdquo; icon. (You can end your move whenever you like, even if several tiles
                have already been turned over.)
                <p><img src="./assets/img/rules-collect-tiles.png"></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>OR you turn over an igloo tile</p>
                <p>If you turn over an igloo tile, it is removed from the table and placed on the corresponding
                    igloo square on the board, marked with one of your meeples on top of it. If you don&rsquo;t have
                    any more meeples left, the igloo tile remains unmarked. You have then helped to build the igloo.
                </p>
                <p>Note: meeples on igloo tiles are important during the Finishing Phase.</p>

                <p><img src="./assets/img/rules-igloo-meeple.png"></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>OR the animals flee</p>
                <p>If animals flee, your move ends and the fleeing animals are turned face down.</p>
                <p>Note: It can happen that several animals flee during one move. For example there is a seal and a
                    herring tile facing up and the player turns up a salmon. The herring flees the salmon and the
                    salmon flees the seal. As a result, herring and salmon are turned face down and the seal is
                    collected.<br>
                    <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-31.png"><img src="./assets/img/rules-example-32.png">
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When your turn has ended, all of the tiles that remain lying face up are collected and put onto your
            stack in a pile.</p>
        <p>It is now the next player&rsquo;s turn ...</p>
        <p>The First Phase ends when the sun piece is moved onto the last field on the board.</p>

        <!-- FINISHING PHASE -->
        <h2>Finishing Phase</h2>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">Blue&rsquo;s last flip turned up a reindeer, this moved the sun into the last
            position.<br>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="./assets/img/rules-sun-position-9.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">Blue collects all face-up tiles from the table and it&rsquo;s Orange&rsquo;s
            turn. These are the remaining tiles on the table:<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-21.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">Orange has one meeple on the igloo. This gives them the right to flip and
            collect tiles until they can predict what they&rsquo;ll turn over.<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-igloo-finish-1.jpg">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">Orange&rsquo;s meeple is removed and the tile underneath is put on their
            stack:<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-igloo-finish-2.jpg">
        </p>
        <p>Orange remembers the position of a polar bear from earlier. They declare that their next flip is
            going to be a polar bear by clicking on the polar bear icon:<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-declare1.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">Next, they select the tile that they think contains the polar bear and the tile
            is flipped over.<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-22.png">
        </p>
        <p class="col-12 col-lg-6 mt-3"> It really is a polar bear, so the tile is removed to Orange&rsquo;s stack.<br>
            <img src="./assets/img/rules-example-23.png">
        </p>
        <p>Since they got it right, Orange can continue on guessing. Now Orange wants to turn over a seal.</p>
        <p><img src="./assets/img/rules-declare2.png">
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Orange turns over a herring tile and their move is over. The tile remains face up on
            the
            table.</p>
        <p><img src="./assets/img/rules-example-24.png">
        </p>
        <p>The move then goes to Blue. Blue has meeples on the igloo,so they remove one along with the tile it
            was on:
        </p>
        <p><img src="./assets/img/rules-igloo-finish-3.jpg">
        </p>
        <p>Blue wants to turn over a salmon:</p>
        <p><img src="./assets/img/rules-declare3.png">
        </p>
        <p>But it is a herring, so the tile remains on the table and the move goes back to Orange.</p>
        <p><img src="./assets/img/rules-example-25.png">
        </p>
        <p>But Orange does not have any meeples left on the igloo, so the move goes back to Blue ...</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>The rules during Finishing Phase</h2>
        <p>After a player has turned over a reindeer and the sun goes into its last position, the move goes to
            the next player. If this player has a meeple on the board, it can now remove one marked igloo tile to
            its stack. The meeple used for marking the tile returns to the player.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s important to remember which animal hides under which tile on the table. Declare a type of tile
            you are going to turn over and flip one tile. If you declared correctly, you collect that one tile into
            your stack. If you were wrong, the tile remains face-up on the table and can not be collected anymore.
        </p>
        <p>If you name the tile correctly, the move remains with you until you miss. Then it is the next
            player&rsquo;s move. If the next player does not have a meeple on the board, then the move goes to the
            next player until neither player can move anymore OR no tile remains.</p>
        <p>The sequence of play is not interrupted, even if one player has several meeples on the igloo.</p>
        <h2>End of the Game</h2>
        <p>The game ends when there are no more meeples on the board or all tiles have been turned over.</p>
        <p>Did you manage to collect the most tiles? If you did, you&rsquo;ve won the game.</p>
