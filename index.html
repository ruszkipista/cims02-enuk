        <h1>RULES OF THE GAME</h1>
        <p>There’s a lot to discover on the ice floes of Greenland …</p>
        <p>Enuk, the little Eskimo boy, is really excited. He’s been looking forward to wandering around with his
            brothers for a long time. Up to now they have only told him stories about all the polar bears and seals they
            encounter, but now he is to get to see the animals for himself. He’s also to be allowed to help build a new
            igloo, and that’s what he’s looking forward to most.</p>
        <p>The players have to try to collect as many animal tiles as possible. The one who has the most tiles is the
            winner!</p>
