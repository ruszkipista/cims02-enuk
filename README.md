### Attention assessor!
I kept a journal during the development about my daily activities, see it [here](./assets/doc/ci-ms2-study-notes-journal.pdf) frozen in time or [live](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eooOU-uZVoeEShXQkXs86pQumJEob1c4Pa6hwJqahNw/edit?usp=sharing).

## 1. UX design
### 1.1 Strategy Plane
Stakeholders of the website:
- player

#### 1.1.1 Goals and Objectives of Stakeholders (users)
|G#|User|Goals, Needs, Objectives|
|--|----|------------------------|
|G1|.|.|

### 1.2 Scope plane
It has been decided to create an interactive website.

The following table lists the planned features, each feature referenced with original goal(s):

|F#|Goal|Feature|
|--|----|-------|
|.|.|.|

### 1.3 User Stories
* As a player

### 1.4 Structure plane
The structure of the website to be built consist of
- a **Home** page,

![pages with navigation links](./assets/doc/ci-ms2-site-structure.jpg "Website structure")

### 1.5 Skeleton plane
Feature list in page/section structure with content hinting and navigation links. The following table is a sample, describes the page **XXX**. Check out the whole list [here](./assets/doc/ci-ms2-features.pdf) in PDF format.

|Page / *section*|Feature#|Feature / Content description|Link or Action|
|--------------|--------|-----------------------------|--------------|
|.|.|.|.|

Created wireframes for **XXX** page in 3 width, see the others as well [here](./assets/doc/ci-ms2-wireframes.pdf) or the balsamiq file [here](./assets/doc/ci-ms2-wireframes.bmpr).

### 1.6 Surface plane
Chose font [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for the headers.

## 2. Features Left to Implement


## 3. Technologies and Tools Used

- The project's product (the website) was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, utilising [Bootstrap 5.0 Beta](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/) framework (which itself uses CSS and JavaScript). Bootstrap is used for its responsive utilities. 
- Manipulated images with program [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/). Mainly used for cropping, resizing, background removal and format conversion.
- Created wireframes with program from [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/)
- Written study notes on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)
- Disassembled a PDF file with [Adobe Acrobat PRO](https://acrobat.adobe.com/ie/en/acrobat.html)
- Edited the code with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the preview was provided via [Live Server](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server) VS Code extension.
- Managed code versions with [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Stored the code and project deliverables cloud service [Github](https://github.com/) repository with versions.
- Deployed the website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- The development machine run [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) operating system.
- The website was tested on desktop on [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ie/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) web browsers, also on a [OnePlus2](https://www.oneplus.com/ie/support/spec/oneplus-2) mobile phone running [Android](https://www.android.com/) and mobile [Chrome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&hl=en) browser.
- Generated favicon with [Favicon & App Icon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)
- Generated one image (on top of this Readme) of how the website looks on different size devices with [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)
- Chose font using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Run CSS code through [Autoprefixer CSS online](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to supplement suggested vendor prefixes
- Searched the internet to find content, documentation and solution for issues using [Google](www.google.com)'s search service.
- connected to the internet using [Vodafone](https://n.vodafone.ie/shop/broadband.html)'s broadband service.

## 4. Issues solved during development
### 4.1 X


## 5. Testing

First step in testing was the validation of HTML, CSS and JS code with [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) respectively. I performed the validations a couple of times during development and once at the end. Now all html pages validate to "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.". The `style.css` file validates to "Congratulations! No Error Found." `The script.js` validates to a couple of readibility warnings which I chose to ignore.

The whole testing were conducted manually.

Here is a sample from the test log, see the complete document [here](./assets/doc/ci-ms2-testing.pdf)

```
Background: 
Desktop device is a desktop Windows 10 operating system running Chrome (on 1920x1080 pixels screen) and Firefox browser (on 1600x1200 pixels screen)
Mobile device is a OnePlus2 mobile phone running OxigenOS 3.6.1 (equivalent to Android 6.0.1) and Chrome Mobile browser on screen resolution 1080x1920 pixels

User Story:

Scenario: 
```
|Test no.|Pre-condition|Event|Expected|Result|Comment|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|on Desktop Chrome,|pass|-|

The website performs on desktop and mobile devices as intended, no responsivity issues were found.

No additional bugs were discovered during the final testing.

## 6. Deployment

The website is deployed to GitHub Pages automatically by GitHub. The assigned web address is [ruszkipista.github.io/cims01-lkc/](https://ruszkipista.github.io/cims01-lkc/).
I followed [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) tutorial to deploy the project on GitHub Pages, these were the steps:
1. On GitHub navigate to the repository's main page
2. Under your repository name, click Settings
![Repository/Settings](./assets/doc/ci-ms2-deployment-1.png "Click on Settings")
3. Under "GitHub Pages", use the None or Branch drop-down menu and select a publishing source
![Settings/GitHub Pages/Branch](./assets/doc/ci-ms2-deployment-2.png "Click on Branch")
4. Optionally, use the drop-down menu to select a folder for your publishing source
![Settings/GitHub Pages/Source](./assets/doc/ci-ms2-deployment-3.png "Click on Root")
5. Click Save
![Settings/GitHub Pages/Save](./assets/doc/ci-ms2-deployment-4.png "Click on Save")
6. After a while you are presented whith this status message at the same place
![Settings/GitHub Pages](./assets/doc/ci-ms2-deployment-5.png "Your site is published")

If you want to deploy this project to a different hosting solution, you need to copy all the files from this repository. Follow the repository cloning steps from [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) tutorial.
After you have your local copies of these files, you copy them into the home folder of the webserver, keeping the folder structure as is.
Just because this is a static website, you can even start up the Home page by double clicking on the `index.html` file in your local file system - effectively launching you default browser with the starting page.
